# Required Assets

I have obfuscated some assets, but for this version of the script, I attach the following
- logo.png: The logo of your organization
- Outreach_Presentation.pdf: The PDF attachment you want to add
- contacts.csv: The mailing list for MailFlower. I have attached a contacts_template.csv to showcase the general layout.

Of course, you can edit file names and which attachments you want to use as you wish.
