# Why is this folder empty?

This folder is where you should paste your Gmail API Key, credentials.json.

When you first run the script, MailFlower will call the OAuth API and require you to sign in to your Google account. This will generate an additional file called token.json.

Ensure that BOTH of these files are present after the first run, else the script will not work!
